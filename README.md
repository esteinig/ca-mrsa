This repository is meant to hold the data and preprint materials for our paper `Phylodynamic signals in the emergence of community-associated MRSA`. We welcome all comments or reviews on the preprint, and would encourage interested parties to create an issue in the repository for an open-source discussion. We will publish all data and workflows / model configurations on submission to Biorxiv.
